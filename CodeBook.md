The data for this exercise is found in a zip archive at this URL:

A general description of the data is found at this URL:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

A more detailed description of the observed variables is found in the
features_info.txt file within the data archive.

Those two sources essentially comprise the code book for the original data.

In this project, the feature variable names were transformed so that they
would be legal names for R variables.

The transformation of variable names was:

   - All instances of "()" were removed
   - All "-" characters were converted to "." characers.
   - All "," characters were converted to "." characers.
   - All duplicate names were made unique by adding a suffix with a "."
     followed by an integer (e.g, the duplicate pair of names "example" and 
     "example" would be converted to "example" and "example.1").
   - All remaining instances of "(" and ")" were converted to "." characters.
   - The instances of "BodyBody" were converted to "Body".  I believe these
     were mistakes in the original data.


So, for example, the original names in the left column were transformed into
the names in the right column:

```
fBodyAcc-mean()-X   =>   fBodyAcc.mean.X
fBodyAcc-mean()-Y   =>   fBodyAcc.mean.Y
fBodyAcc-mean()-Z   =>   fBodyAcc.mean.Z
fBodyAcc-std()-X    =>   fBodyAcc.std.X
fBodyAcc-std()-Y    =>   fBodyAcc.std.Y
fBodyAcc-std()-Z    =>   fBodyAcc.std.Z
```

The features that start with "f" are frequency domain observations and those
that begin with "t" are time domain observations.  The X, Y, and Z suffixes
denote the three axial dimensions. 

All values are normalized and bounded within [-1, 1].  The units for the
original observations of linear acceleration were standard gravitational
acceleration (g).  The units for the original observations of angular
velocity were radians per second.  However, since the data has been
normalized, the data no longer have standard units.

The full set of 66 feature names in the datasets generated by run_analysis.R
are shown below, with explanations of the names.  These are the variables
that capture mean and standard deviation data.

The run_analysis.R script generates two data sets.

Here is what the combined data set looks like, selecting the first 10 rows
and only the first five columns:
